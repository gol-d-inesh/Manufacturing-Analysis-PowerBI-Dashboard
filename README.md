**ðŸ§¾ Background**

ProManu Analytics, a consultancy specializing in manufacturing analytics, provided two datasets:

**1. Manufacturing Production Data** â€“ Details on products, production dates, costs, quantities, and warehouse locations.                
**2. Employee Performance Metrics** â€“ Information about employees, departments, salaries, performance ratings, and countries of operation.
In manufacturing, efficiency, cost management, and workforce productivity are interlinked. This project aims to analyze these datasets comprehensively to support decision-making, streamline production, and enhance employee performance.
