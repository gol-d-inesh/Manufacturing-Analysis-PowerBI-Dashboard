**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing manufacturing and employee performance data to uncover trends, optimize operations, and improve efficiency. Using Power BI, we performed data cleaning, modeling, and advanced DAX analytics to create an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for manufacturing firms.

**ðŸ§¾ Background**

ProManu Analytics, a consultancy specializing in manufacturing analytics, provided two datasets:

**1. Manufacturing Production Data** â€“ Details on products, production dates, costs, quantities, and warehouse locations.                
**2. Employee Performance Metrics** â€“ Information about employees, departments, salaries, performance ratings, and countries of operation.
In manufacturing, efficiency, cost management, and workforce productivity are interlinked. This project aims to analyze these datasets comprehensively to support decision-making, streamline production, and enhance employee performance.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**

- Clean and preprocess manufacturing and employee datasets.
- Model the data in Power BI for robust relational analysis.
- Apply DAX measures to derive insights into production efficiency, employee performance, and cost trends.
- Build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard highlighting production metrics, employee data, and operational trends.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve manufacturing efficiency and workforce productivity.

**ðŸ”Ž Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX**     
Key analysis steps performed in Power BI:

âœ… Import datasets and examine for anomalies or inconsistencies     
âœ… Handle missing and irrelevant data; remove duplicates  
âœ… Merge datasets using ProductID as the key  
âœ… Normalize data types and categorize product types  
âœ… Analyze production costs (average cost per product type, cost efficiency)  
âœ… Examine employee distribution across departments and countries  
âœ… Analyze performance ratings and correlations with salaries  
âœ… Warehouse efficiency analysis (average quantity stored per location)  
âœ… Trends in salaries, production volume, and product lifecycle  
âœ… Advanced DAX measures: predictive modeling for product demand, cost efficiency, and time-series forecasting  
âœ… Employee training records transformed to extract training dates and types  
âœ… Identify anomalies in production and cost data  
**Insights derived:** Top-performing departments, high-cost product types, optimal warehouse utilization, correlation between performance and salaries, seasonal production trends, and cost-efficiency metrics.
